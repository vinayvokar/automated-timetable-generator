Small Description
The Automated Timetable Generator is a web-based solution that automatically generates optimized class schedules based on predefined rules like class availability, faculty schedules, and room assignments. It simplifies the time-consuming task of manually creating timetables, ensuring minimal conflicts and efficient resource allocation.

3 Key Learnings
Developing dynamic user interfaces with React.js.
Efficient database management with Laravel and MySQL.
Building and testing RESTful APIs for system interaction.
Future Scope and Improvements
The system can be further enhanced by integrating machine learning algorithms to predict optimal schedules based on historical data and preferences. This would allow the system to learn from past schedules and optimize future ones dynamically. Additionally, introducing a mobile application version of the timetable generator will improve accessibility for students and faculty, allowing them to check and update their schedules on the go.

Another potential improvement is incorporating real-time schedule adjustments based on unexpected changes, like faculty availability or room assignments, using notifications and instant updates. Integration with institutional APIs and calendars would provide seamless synchronization with other academic systems, ensuring the timetables remain up-to-date and conflict-free.
